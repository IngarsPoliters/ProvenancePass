# RFC Template: [Title]

- **RFC**: 0001
- **Title**: RFC Process Template
- **Author**: ProvenancePass Team
- **Status**: Final
- **Type**: Process
- **Created**: 2024-08-19
- **Updated**: 2024-08-19

## Summary

This RFC establishes the template and process for proposing changes to the Provenance Passport specification. It defines the structure, review process, and lifecycle management for specification improvements.

## Motivation

As the Provenance Passport specification evolves, we need a structured process for:
- Proposing backward-compatible enhancements
- Managing breaking changes carefully
- Ensuring community input on significant changes
- Maintaining specification quality and consistency
- Documenting the rationale behind design decisions

## Guide-level Explanation

### What is an RFC?

An RFC (Request for Comments) is a design document that describes a new feature, process, or significant change to the Provenance Passport specification. RFCs ensure that:

1. **Community Input**: Stakeholders can review and provide feedback
2. **Design Rationale**: Decisions are documented for future reference
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Clear specification for implementers
4. **Compatibility Planning**: Breaking changes are carefully considered

### When to Write an RFC

**You should write an RFC for:**
- New schema fields or structures
- Cryptographic algorithm changes
- Breaking changes to existing behavior
- New embedding methods or formats
- Significant process changes
- Major implementation requirements

**You don't need an RFC for:**
- Bug fixes to existing specifications
- Clarifications that don't change behavior
- Documentation improvements
- Minor typo corrections
- Implementation-specific optimizations

### RFC Process Overview

```
1. Draft → 2. Discussion → 3. Review → 4. Decision → 5. Implementation
```

1. **Draft**: Author creates RFC using this template
2. **Discussion**: Community provides feedback (minimum 2 weeks)
3. **Review**: Maintainers evaluate technical feasibility
4. **Decision**: RFC is accepted, rejected, or requires revision
5. **Implementation**: Changes are implemented and tested

## Reference-level Explanation

### RFC Document Structure

#### **Header**
Every RFC must include:
- **RFC Number**: Sequential number assigned by maintainers
- **Title**: Clear, concise description of the proposal
- **Author**: Name and contact information
- **Status**: Draft, Accepted, Final, Withdrawn, Superseded
- **Type**: Feature, Process, Breaking Change
- **Created**: Original creation date
- **Updated**: Last modification date

#### **Required Sections**
1. **Summary**: One-paragraph overview
2. **Motivation**: Why this change is needed
3. **Guide-level Explanation**: High-level description for users
4. **Reference-level Explanation**: Technical specification details
5. **Drawbacks**: Potential negative impacts
6. **Rationale and Alternatives**: Why this approach vs. others
7. **Prior Art**: Existing solutions in other systems
8. **Unresolved Questions**: Open issues for discussion
9. **Future Possibilities**: Potential extensions

### RFC Types

#### **Feature RFCs**
- Add new optional fields to passport schema
- Introduce new embedding methods
- Extend existing functionality
- Must maintain backward compatibility

#### **Breaking Change RFCs**
- Modify required fields
- Change validation rules
- Update cryptographic requirements
- Require major version increment

#### **Process RFCs**
- Change specification development process
- Update governance or decision-making
- Modify RFC process itself

### Status Definitions

| Status | Description | Next Steps |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Draft** | Initial proposal, seeking feedback | Community discussion |
| **Accepted** | Approved for implementation | Development and testing |
| **Final** | Implemented and released | Include in changelog |
| **Withdrawn** | Author abandoned proposal | Archive for reference |
| **Superseded** | Replaced by newer RFC | Link to replacement |

### Numbering Convention

- **0001-0099**: Process and governance RFCs
- **0100-0199**: Schema and format RFCs
- **0200-0299**: Cryptographic and security RFCs
- **0300-0399**: Embedding and storage RFCs
- **0400-0499**: Policy and validation RFCs
- **0500+**: Implementation and tooling RFCs

## Drawbacks

### Administrative Overhead
- RFC process adds time to specification changes
- May slow down simple improvements
- Requires community engagement and review

### Potential Barriers
- Complex process might discourage contributions
- Not all changes require extensive design discussion
- May create false sense of formality for simple changes

## Rationale and Alternatives

### Why RFCs?

**Considered Alternatives:**
1. **Ad-hoc changes**: Risk of breaking compatibility
2. **Issue-based discussions**: Lack structured documentation
3. **Direct commits**: No community input opportunity

**RFC Benefits:**
- Structured design thinking
- Community involvement
- Design rationale documentation
- Compatibility consideration forcing function

### Process Inspiration
Based on successful RFC processes from:
- **Rust**: [RFC process](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs)
- **React**: [RFC process](https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs)
- **Ember**: [RFC process](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs)

## Prior Art

### Industry Standards Processes
- **IETF RFCs**: Internet standards development
- **W3C Recommendations**: Web standards process
- **OASIS Standards**: Structured markup and web services
- **JSON Schema**: Community-driven schema evolution

### Open Source Examples
- **Python PEPs**: Python Enhancement Proposals
- **Node.js NEPs**: Node Enhancement Proposals
- **Kubernetes KEPs**: Kubernetes Enhancement Proposals

## Unresolved Questions

### Community Size
- How do we ensure adequate review with small community?
- What constitutes sufficient feedback for approval?
- How to balance speed vs. thoroughness?

### Implementation Requirements
- Should RFCs require working implementation before acceptance?
- How to handle implementation-dependent design decisions?
- What level of conformance testing is required?

### Backward Compatibility
- How strictly do we maintain backward compatibility?
- When is breaking compatibility justified?
- How to communicate breaking changes effectively?

## Future Possibilities

### Enhanced Process
- **Implementation Tracking**: Link RFCs to implementation status
- **Automated Testing**: Require conformance tests for all RFCs
- **Community Voting**: Formal community input mechanisms
- **Expert Review**: Domain expert review for cryptographic changes

### Tooling Integration
- **RFC Repository**: Dedicated repository for RFC management
- **Status Dashboard**: Visual tracking of RFC progress
- **Implementation Matrix**: Track RFC implementation across tools
- **Automated Validation**: Lint RFC documents for completeness

## Template Usage

### Creating a New RFC

1. **Copy this template** to `docs/spec/rfcs/NNNN-title.md`
2. **Fill in the header** with appropriate information
3. **Write each section** following the guidance above
4. **Open a PR** with the RFC document
5. **Announce for discussion** in GitHub issues or discussions

### RFC Filename Convention
```
NNNN-short-descriptive-title.md
```

Examples:
