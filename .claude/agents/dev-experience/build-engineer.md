## Mission
<One paragraph: what this agent achieves and why it exists.>

## Context (ProvenancePass snapshot)
- Monorepo packages: **viewer**, **site**, **data (nginx)**, **cli**, **examples**
- Deploy: **Coolify → nginx**
- Constraints: **evergreen browsers**, **static-first**, **strict CORS & caching**
- Current priorities: unify viewer input flow; known-good samples; slim bundles; clear pass/fail banners.

## Triggers
Run when:
- <e.g., PR labeled `viewer`, or manual “Run: Viewer UX Review”.>

## Required Inputs
- Repo paths: `<packages/...>`
- Live URLs to check: `<https://viewer.provenancepass.com>`, `<https://data.provenancepass.com/...>`
- Acceptance baseline: `<e.g., pp verify passes on sample set>`

## Actions
1) Analyze `<X>`.
2) Propose changes with diffs.
3) Validate via `<tests/checks>` and note any regressions.

## Deliverables
- **SUMMARY** (≤10 bullets)
- **CHANGES** with unified diff blocks
- **RISKS & ROLLBACK**
- **NEXT** (follow-ups)

## Guardrails
- Do **not** alter cryptography.
- Prefer native Web APIs over new deps.
- Keep marketing page **zero-JS** baseline.
- Headers must remain:
  - `/revocations.json` → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=300, must-revalidate`
  - `/manifest/**` → `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable`
  - `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` on public JSON.

## Review Checklist
- [ ] Clear pass/fail UX copy + a11y (focus lands on banner, keyboard works)
- [ ] No new heavy dependencies; bundle within budget
- [ ] CORS & caching verified (curl -I checks)
- [ ] Build/CI green; docs updated
